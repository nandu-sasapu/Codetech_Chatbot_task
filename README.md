# Java Chatbot with AWT GUI

## Overview

This Java project implements a simple chatbot with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java's Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). The chatbot interacts with users by processing natural language input and generating appropriate responses based on predefined rules.

## Requirements

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Development Environment**: Java Development Kit (JDK), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
- **System Specifications**: Any platform capable of running Java applications with JDK installed

## Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is to create an interactive chatbot that:

- Understands and responds to user queries in natural language.
- Provides a seamless and intuitive user experience through a graphical interface.

## GUI Components

The chatbot GUI is constructed using AWT components including:

- `Frame`: Main window of the application.
- `Panel`: Containers for organizing GUI elements.
- `TextField`: Input field for user queries.
- `TextArea`: Display area for chat messages.
- `Button`: Interactive buttons for user actions.

## Project Structure

- **ChatbotGUI.java**: Main class implementing the chatbot's GUI and interaction logic.
- **README.md**: Documentation providing project overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Setup and Execution

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Running the Chatbot

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Compile and run the `ChatbotGUI.java` file to launch the chatbot application.
4. Interact with the chatbot by typing messages in the input field and pressing `Enter` or clicking `Send`.

## Implementation Details

- The chatbot uses a simple rule-based approach to interpret user queries and generate responses.
- User input is processed using basic string matching techniques to identify keywords and trigger appropriate actions.
- Responses are displayed in the chat area based on predefined rules for common user queries.

## Enhancements and Future Work

To improve the chatbot and enhance user interaction, consider implementing:

- Advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for more accurate query understanding.
- Expanded response database with a wider range of conversational topics and actions.
- Improved GUI design with additional features such as emoticons, interactive buttons, and customizable themes.
