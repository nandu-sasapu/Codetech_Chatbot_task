## Chatbot Application using Java AWT

This project implements a simple chatbot application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java's Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). The chatbot interprets user input, processes queries, and generates appropriate responses based on predefined rules. The GUI allows users to interact with the chatbot in a visually intuitive manner.

### Features

- **Graphical User Interface:** AWT components used to create a user-friendly interface for chatbot interaction.
  
- **Text Input:** Users can type queries into a text field and submit them to the chatbot.
  
- **Response Display:** Chatbot responses are displayed in a text area within the GUI for easy viewing.

### Technologies Used

- **Java:** Core programming language used for application development.
  
- **AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit):** Java library for creating GUI components and interfaces.
  
### Setup and Usage

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
   - IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
